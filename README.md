## What's included

This formula sheet covers essential actuarial concepts including:

- **Probability and Statistics**: Common distributions used in actuarial science (exponential, gamma, Weibull, Pareto, etc.)
- **Life Tables**: Mortality functions, survival probabilities, life expectancies.
- **Annuities**: Present and future values of various annuity types.
- **Life Insurance**: Net single premiums, reserves, and policy values.
- **Risk Theory**: Individual and collective risk models, ruin probability.
- **Financial Mathematics**: Interest rates, present value calculations, bonds.
- **Credibility Theory**: Classical and Bayesian credibility formulas.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### Are these formulas sufficient for actuarial exams?

While this sheet covers fundamental formulas, it should be used as a supplement to comprehensive study materials for professional actuarial examinations. Always refer to the official syllabus and study materials for your specific exam.

### Why focus on these particular topics?

The topics included represent core mathematical foundations that every actuary should know, regardless of their specialization area. These formulas appear frequently in both academic coursework and professional practice.
